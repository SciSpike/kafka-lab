## Introduction

In this lab we'll use Java and Maven to create a typical Java based producer and consumer of Kafka messages. You have
two options for running Maven and Java. Either, you install them natively or you can run the tools through a docker
container.

## Two separate labs

This lab consists of two parts. In the first part, we'll create a producer that can create messages in Kafka. In the
second part, we'll consume these messages.

Both the `consumer` and `producer` are written in Java.

If you're not proficient in Java, you may want to simply study the solution or if you can pair program with someone that
is.

Here are the links to the labs:
