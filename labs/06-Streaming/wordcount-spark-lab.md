# Spark Streaming with Kafka Example

## Introductions

In this example, we will write a Spark Streaming program that consumes messages from Kafka.

We will reuse the whole setup from the previous lab, so this lab is best done as a continuation of Kafka Streaming
setup.

For Spark, we will use Scala. To build the program, you will need to download SBT, the Scala Build Tool. This is an easy
install! Follow the installation instructions from the site <http://www.scala-sbt.org/> and install it for your machine.

## Spark Streaming Program

```scala
package com.scispike.kafka

import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.{StringDeserializer, StringSerializer}
import org.apache.spark.SparkConf
import org.apache.spark.streaming.kafka010.ConsumerStrategies.Subscribe
import org.apache.spark.streaming.kafka010.LocationStrategies.PreferConsistent
import org.apache.spark.streaming.kafka010._
import org.apache.spark.streaming.{Duration, Seconds, StreamingContext}

import org.apache.log4j.{Level, Logger}

object SparkKafka {

  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println("Spark Kafka Example - Word count from a Kafka stream")
    if (args.length < 3) {
      System.err.println(s"""
                            |Usage: SparkKafka <brokers> <topics> <interval>
                            |  <brokers> is a list of one or more Kafka brokers: broker1,broker2
                            |  <topics> is a list of one or more kafka topics to consume from
                            |  <interval> interval duration (ms)
                            |
        """.stripMargin)
      System.exit(1)
    }

    // Show only errors in console
    val rootLogger = Logger.getRootLogger()
    rootLogger.setLevel(Level.ERROR)

    // Consume command line parameters
    val Array(brokers, topics, interval) = args

    // Create Spark configuration
    val sparkConf = new SparkConf().setAppName("SparkKafka")

    // Create streaming context, with batch duration in ms
    val ssc = new StreamingContext(sparkConf, Duration(interval.toLong))
    ssc.checkpoint("./output")


    // Create a set of topics from a string
    val topicsSet = topics.split(",").toSet

    // Define Kafka parameters
    val kafkaParams = Map[String, Object](
      "bootstrap.servers" -> brokers,
      "key.deserializer" -> classOf[StringDeserializer],
      "value.deserializer" -> classOf[StringDeserializer],
      "group.id" -> "use_a_separate_group_id_for_each_stream",
      "auto.offset.reset" -> "latest",
      "enable.auto.commit" -> (false: java.lang.Boolean))


    // Create a Kafka stream
    val stream = KafkaUtils.createDirectStream[String, String](
      ssc, PreferConsistent, Subscribe[String, String](topicsSet,kafkaParams))

    // Get messages - lines of text from Kafka
    val lines = stream.map(consumerRecord => consumerRecord.value)

    // Split lines into words
    val words = lines.flatMap(_.split(" "))

    // Map every word to a tuple
    val wordMap = words.map(word => (word, 1))

    // Count occurrences of each word
    val wordCount = wordMap.reduceByKey(_ + _)

    //Print the word count
    wordCount.print()

    // Start stream processing
    ssc.start()
    ssc.awaitTermination()
  }

}
```

## Building and Packaging the Spark Program

Go to the directory `spark-kafka`. You will see that it contains the file `build.sbt`. We will use it to compile and
build a jar file that we can deploy to Spark.

In that directory run the command in the terminal:

```
sbt assembly
```

The first time you run sbt, it may take a while, as SBT needs to download Scala in the right version and all needed
libraries.

The result is that the jar file is created in the directory `target/scala-2.11/spark-kafka.jar`.

## Deploying the Program to Dockerized Spark

We will move the file to the directory from where we will deploy to Spark:

```
mv target/scala-2.11/spark-kafka.jar ../docker/spark/
```

Go to the `docker` directory and run the deployment command.

If you don't have the docker cluster running already, you'll have to first run the `docker-compose up` command.

Run the command to submit the jar to Spark. The directory `app` in the image is mapped to directory `spark` on our
machine, as set in the `volumes` parameter in the `docker-compose.yml` file. We are also passing command line parameters
for the broker, topic, and interval:

```
docker-compose exec master spark-submit \
  --master spark://master:7077 \
  /app/spark-kafka.jar \
  kafka:9092 stream-input 2000
```

The program should be running and waiting for the input from the `stream-input` topic.

In terminal, you should see the output of Spark Streaming:

```

-------------------------------------------
Time: 1497743366000 ms
-------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------
Time: 1497743368000 ms
-------------------------------------------
```

Soon, we will see some word counts!

> In some instances, we have observed crashes of the Spark program on deployment. If that happens, just re-run the previous command again. Sometimes, the dockerized Spark does not start until we attempt to deploy to it. You can observe the console of the docker compose and you will notice the logs for the start of the Spark master.

## Running the Spark Streaming with Kafka

Run the producer as in the previous lab. Enter some text and observe the output.

In the producer terminal, run the producer and then enter a line of text:

```
$ docker-compose exec kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list kafka:9092 --topic stream-input
hello hello hi
```

In the Spark terminal, you will see the word counts for the interval:

```
-------------------------------------------
Time: 1497746685000 ms
-------------------------------------------
(hello,2)
(hi,1)
```

## Done!

Congratulations - You've made it!
