# Kafka Course

## Welcome

First, welcome to this course on Kafka.

Although Kafka is quite simple to install, we decided to make base it on `Docker` and `Docker-Compose`.
This gives us a couple of advantages:

- Easier installation:
  - As long as you can get Docker to run, we know that the Kafka installation will work
  - Install docker, then simply run the `docker compose` file
- Consistency between Windows, Mac and Linux
- The ability to scale up and down the Kafka cluster
