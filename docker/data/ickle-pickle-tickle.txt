Ickle Me, Pickle Me, Tickle Me too
Went for a ride in a flying shoe
"Hooray"
"What fun"
"It's time we flew"
Said Ickle Me, Pickle Me, Tickle Me too
Ickle was captain, and Pickle was crew
And Tickle served coffee and mulligan stew
As higher, and higher
And higher they flew
Ickle Me, Pickle Me, Tickle Me too
Ickle Me, Pickle Me, Tickle Me too
Over the sun and beyond the blue
"Hold on"
"Stay in"
"I hope we do"
Cried Ickle Me, Pickle Me, Tickle Me too
Ickle Me, Pickle Me, Tickle too
Never returned to the world they knew
And nobody knows
What's happened to
Dear Ickle Me, Pickle Me, Tickle Me too
